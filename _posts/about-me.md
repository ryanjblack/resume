## Florida Born + Raised

I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale for most of my life, and have lived and thrived in Tampa since 2011. I graduated from USF in 2015 with my BA in Journalism and from UF in 2018 with my MAMC in Web Design.

I love where I live, and take advantage of all that the bay area has to offer - the outdoors, the beach, excellent craft beer, minor and major league sports and friends that make it all worth while.
