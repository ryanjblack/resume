## Florida Born + Raised

I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale for most of my life, and have lived and thrived in Tampa since 2011. I graduated from USF in 2015 with my BA in Journalism and from UF in 2018 with my MAMC in Web Design.

I love where I live, and take advantage of all that the bay area has to offer - the outdoors, the beach, excellent craft beer, minor and major league sports and friends that make it all worth while.

## Work Examples

From web design to CRM management, I have a sizable portfolio to share with you. Whether it's B2B, B2C, or <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href=" https://www.vantagepointsoftware.com/">SaaS</a> I have experience with all facets of modern marketing approaches and how to build and admin websites to facilitate those approaches.

### Web Design + Development

I have over 4 years of web design and development experience, and I have worked across several industries, banners and verticals. I can code in many popular languages and I know the best practices to optimize a website's performance, search engine visibility and UI/UX.

### WordPress

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/web-design-tcb.gif" /></div>

Here is an example of a <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://ryanjblack.xyz/wp-template/">WordPress theme I made for a client.</a> This site is built for B2B and B2C purposes, with a simple-to-use inventory system.

### React/next.JS

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/react-md.PNG" /></div>

The current website you are on was coded within a React framework using next.JS and markdown-to-HTML5 files.

### HTML5 + CSS3 Animation

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/HTML5-CSS3.gif" /></div>

Check out this depth-defying project <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://ryanjblack.xyz/p3_black_ryan/">made entirely using CSS3 animation.</a>

As a fun project, I worked with a group of coders to create <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://ryanjblack.xyz/outtatime/">this BTTF-inspired fan project.</a>

Here's some more <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://ryanjblack.xyz/hw4_black_ryan/">CSS3 animation goodness.</a>

### SEO + SEM

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/lawnparts-seo.gif" /></div>

One of the main areas I focused on early in my career and education was search engine optimization (from a technical and creative standpoint) as well as search engine marketing.

Having a site that loads quickly, that features rich, informative copy and is easily found on a search is vital for a business's visibility and marketing performance.

My first SEO client many years ago (before the responsive web!) <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://lawnpartspro.com/">LawnPartsPro</a> used an outside blog with social media campaigns to boost visibility for the main business <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="https://powermowersales.com/">PowerMowerSales</a>. I also adjusted the main site's copy, alt text and site map organization during their last major site overhaul.

Since then I have provided my SEO + SEM specialty for every client I have worked with and seen positive results in user engagements and site performance.

### Web Marketing Audits

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/audits-rebrands-seo.png" /></div>

Before embarking on a major site overhaul, it's critical to <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://www.ryanjblack.xyz/TampaBayWatchFinalReport.pdf">perform key research and audit</a> the current state of the business and its web presence. I have conducted dozens upon dozens of audits for clients around the US and Canada. In my time as an Internet Marketing Specialist at Club Z! and Acti-Kare I would conduct audits for each individual franchise location, which is something I have also done for NPOs, international restaurant chains and many more types of businesses.

Tampa Bay Watch recently overhauled their entire digital marketing presence <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="https://tampabaywatch.org/">and website</a> based on my audit.

## CRM / Email Marketing

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/crm-pardot.gif" /></div>

Email marketing and collecting user data is a cornerstone for a successful marketing campaign, and one of my favorite parts of the entire marketing process.

I am passionate about automated email marketing - from deliverability, A/B testing, segmentation and creating engagement programs for customer funnels/journeys.

I have several dozen hours trained in Salesforce, Pardot, Infusionsoft and HubSpot as well as other platforms such as Constant Contact and MailChimp.  

When I am coding emails and creating automated engagement campaigns <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://www.ryanjblack.xyz/email-example-folder.zip">that is my happy place.</a>

### Content Marketing

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/content-seo-marketing.gif" /></div>

I have a background in old-school journalism and news-editing, so I am extremely comfortable composing and arranging copy <a class="hover:underline text-blue-600" href="http://www.ryanjblack.xyz/copywriting-email-mktg.zip">like these newsletter examples</a> for franchisees.

### Video Production

<div class="px-4 py-2 m-2"><img class="m:auto" src="/assets/blog/preview/video-ex.png" /></div>
