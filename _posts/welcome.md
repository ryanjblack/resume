## Digital Marketing

I think digital marketing encompasses a great portion of what I do.
I have hands-on experience with various CRM platforms and a birds-eye perspective on the inner machinations of capturing and converting customers throughout each process of the marketing funnel.

### CRM

I have several years of experience and extensive training with sophisticated automated CRM platforms such as Salesforce, Pardot, Infusionsoft and HubSpot.

### Content

From landing pages to entire websites, SEO auditing and A/B testing, I have technical and creative experience with producing, editing and auditing content.

### Email Marketing

Emails are an integral part of any marketing plan and one of my passion areas. I can code the landing pages, emails, sequence the entire campaign, conduct split testing and review the deliverability and performance reports.

## Front-End Design + Development

I have been coding for over 4 years and I have seen trends, strategies and approaches of all kinds when it comes to web development solutions - and I am proficient in all of them. From next-gen approaches like next.JS, Gatsby and React, to WordPress development and WYSISYG editors I can meet the needs of any business or marketing team.

### Coding

I learned to code while getting my master's degree in web design from the University of Florida, some of the languages I am best at include: HTML5, CSS3, various JS frameworks (next.js, jQuery, Gatsby), PHP, React

### SEO + SEM

I am an expert at understanding what best optimizes pages for search engine results. My process begins with research and implementing a strategy that will meet all needs - from the user to the client. I am familiar with all aspects of modern SEO and SEM from content, page speed, optimizing older content, anchor text,  capitalizing on competitors and coming up with a keyword plan of action,

### Project Coordination

I thrive working with teams and leading projects - it's where I learn the most and the best way to optimize everyone's strengths and maximize ROI. I have lead several teams and vendors in overhauling sites and modern marketing plans, from web development to SEO to email deliverability.
